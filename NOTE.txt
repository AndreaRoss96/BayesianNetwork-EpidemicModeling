Restriction Policy:
 - None   (e.g. herd immunity)
 - Light  (e.g. mask mandatory in public spaces, ban on gathering)
 - Medium (e.g. Lockdown with exceptions for workers, travel restrictions)
 - severe (e.g. Lockdown including productive activities, country isolation)
 - Extreme (e.g. Martial law)

S: The number of susceptible individuals. 
When a susceptible and an infectious individual come into "infectious contact", 
the susceptible individual contracts the disease and transitions to the infectious compartment.
I: The number of infectious individuals. 
These are individuals who have been infected and are capable of infecting susceptible 
individuals.
R for the number of removed (and immune) or deceased individuals.
These are individuals who have been infected and have either recovered from the disease 
and entered the removed compartment, or died. It is assumed that the number of deaths is 
negligible with respect to the total population. This compartment may also be called 
"recovered" or "resistant".
